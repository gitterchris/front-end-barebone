# Front End Barebone

## Description

Sometimes, I need to start developing a new application with the same set of technologies that I am familiar with. I am mostly spending a lot of time simply setting up the environment. I usually want to separate my /src directory and build a /dist directory after successful compilation. I also want spec files to reside on the same path as the system under test. 

This repo will have all you need to start a front end application. It has no functionality, except for the index page but it has the necessary tools and setup to get started. This repo utilizes the following technologies:

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)
- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) for unit testing
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
